**lastchat**
========

I am living behind company's firewall, which is blocking all popular chat applications. Also I want some interest features like "_rolling a dice during a group talk_". That's why I decide to build _lastchat_.

I'm a .NET developer but I choose to build this application using web.py, and host it on GAE. I'm almost new to all these technologies but it's a lot of fun to learn new stuff.

The application will be deployed here: [http://talk-here.appspot.com/](http://talk-here.appspot.com/). 

Here is a feature list I'm working on. See wiki [Requirements](https://github.com/lastp/lastchat/wiki/Requirements)
